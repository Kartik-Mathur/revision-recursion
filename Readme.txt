- Recursion Teaching Class — Summary
- Overview

This class introduced the fundamental concept of recursion — the process where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. Students learned how to identify base cases, apply recursive logic, and trace recursive function calls effectively.

- Objectives

Understand the concept and mechanics of recursion.

Differentiate between base case and recursive case.

Analyze the flow of recursive calls and stack behavior.

Develop recursive solutions for common programming problems.
